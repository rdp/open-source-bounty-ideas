open source/donation-ware app store

donation-ware-able

"feedback/donate for feature" link

instructions on adding donate link to distro :)

they need some way to be able to know which trac items (et al) are most popular...that seems to be lacking somewhat...

see also the popularize README


maybe I can leverage some open source equivalent of uservoice?

maybe main goal should be to move the project forward, not to make money while doing it?

maybe alerts when it reaches y dollars? bids from people, that would work :P


allow for bids for people (maybe they can even insert their own one just to bid on it).

allow for large list of "possible open source project ideas" like my other thoughts LOL 

"open source app store"

"would you like to buy a service contract"?

"verified x free"

free getsatisfaction that includes dollars, basically...
